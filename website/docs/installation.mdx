## Installing R
---

Robyn is built in R-only at the moment and requries the [R 4.0.0 version (or higher)](https://www.r-project.org/). The recommended IDE is [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).


## Installing Robyn
---

There're two versions of Robyn: The stable version on CRAN and the dev version on GitHub.

Install latest stable CRAN version, run:
```
install.packages("Robyn")
```
Install latest dev version, run:

```
remotes::install_github("facebookexperimental/Robyn/R")
```
**NOTE**: Robyn requires an one-time installation of the Python library [Nevergrad](https://facebookresearch.github.io/nevergrad/) using the R package `reticulate`. Please refer to this [Nevergrad installation](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Robyn/blob/main/demo/install_nevergrad.R) guide for R.
