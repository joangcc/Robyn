### What is Robyn?
Robyn is an experimental, AI/ML-powered and open sourced Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) package from Meta Marketing Science. The automation is enabled through various techniques like the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for hyperparameter optimisation, time-series decomposition for trend & season, Ridge regression for model fitting & gradient-based optimizer for budget allocation. Robyn is built for granular datasets with many independent variables and therefore especially suitable for digital and direct response advertisers with rich data sources.

### Why did we build this?
